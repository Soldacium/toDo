Web app mean to saving and reading notes via LocalStorage API

Note: while this code makes sense and it is 'Readable', this app taught me importance of separation of concerns in angular, I've already starded building/built project where I try to split my code into more pieces as to make it clearer and better. This is good lesson, scalable app needs to be built better from the very ground up.

Still, as I said, good enough, will redo it better in future.
